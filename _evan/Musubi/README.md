# :sushi: Musubi :sushi:
A one-stop-shop for all of your oscillator processing needs.
- Envelope generator
- VCA
- VCF
- Multi-FX (reverb, delay, distortion, DJ filter)

## Installation Instructions
Head over to [BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md](../BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for detailed build instructions.

## Usage Instructions
### Controls
* `CTRL 1-4`: Controls the corresponding on-screen menu options
* `ENC 1`
    - Rotate to change menu page
    - Press to load saved settings & state
    - Briefy hold to save current settings & state
    - Hold until the on-screen loading bar completes to change between the main menu and the settings menus
* `IN 1-4`: Oscillator inputs
* `OUT 1`, `OUT 2`: Stereo master output
* `OUT 3`, `OUT 4`: Stereo master output (identical)
* `GATE IN 1`: Trigger/gate input
* `CV OUT 1`: Envelope output #1 (0-5v CV for the envelope, can be attenuated in settings)
* `CV OUT 2`: Envelope output #2

### Signal flow
1. Oscillator inputs
2. Mixer ("Levels")
3. Panning
4. VCA (amplitude/volume envelope)
5. Distortion (if distortion is set to pre-filter)
6. VCF (filter envelope)
7. Distortion (if distortion is set to post-filter)
8. DJ filter 
7. Delay
8. Reverb

### Menu
**Main menu Pages**
1. Env 
    1. Attack
    2. Hold
    3. Release
    4. Cutoff frequency (Same as LPF #4; having access to it here allows this to be the default "performance page")
3. LPF
    1. Drive
    2. Filter envelope amount
    3. Resonance
    4. Cutoff frequency
4. FX
    1. DJ filter
    2. Reverb amount (feedback + mix)
    3. Delay amount (feedback + mix)
    4. Delay time
4. Env
    1. Attack shape (concave/convex)
    2. Release shape
    3. Cascade: Determines the behavior when a new envelope is triggered while the old one is still running.
        * Reset: New envelope will start from zero
        * Cascade: Old envelope's level will be held until new envelope exceeds it
    4. Toggle VCA (Output will still be muted after envelope cycle has completed)

**Settings menu pages**
1. Volume
    1. Ch1
    2. Ch2
    3. Ch3
    4. Ch4
2. Panning
    1. Ch1
    2. Ch2
    3. Ch3
    4. Ch4
3. Misc
    1. Gate/trig toggle
        - Gate: Envelope will hold for as long as the gate input is high
        - Trig: Envelope will only hold for as long as the hold setting
    2. Filter type
        - Normal: A digital filter from the DaisySP library (svf)
        - Moog: A moog ladder filter emulation
    3. Env out 1 level (attenuates the envelope output to `GATE OUT 1`)
    4. Env out 2 level
4. Reverb
    1. HPF level
    2. LPF level
    3. 
    4. Predelay
5. Delay
    1. HPF level
    2. LPF level
    3. 
    4. Toggle ping pong
6. Distortion
    1. Type (algorithm)
        - Bypass
        - Tanh
        - Atan
        - HardClip
        - SoftClip
        - Saturate
        - Bitcrush
6. System
    1. 
    <!-- Output routing options, concerning Patches 4 audio outputs.  Entries prefixed with 'mx' will have the selected inputs bypass the envelope generator and fx. This allows musubi to be simultaneously used as a mixer and an EG. It's a bit of a wierd function but we might as well make use of Patches many IO jacks. If enabled (not "None"), outputs 3/4 will instead be  
        1. stereo  2 stereo outs (1+2, 3+4)
        2. mono    4 mono outs (1, 2, 3, 4)
        3. mx 1    channel 1 bypasses EG. 2 stereo outs: 1+2 is EG output, 3+4 is mixer output
        4. mx 1-2
        5. mx 1-3
        6. mx 1-4 -->
    2. CV catch: If true, turning a knob won't adjust the corresponding parameter until you "catch" it by moving the knob to that parameter's previous value. This prevents jumps in parameter values when adjusting after changing the page.
    3. Envelope on: "No" will disable the envelope, bypassing the VCA and VCF. This allows Musubi to be used as a mixer/fx unit in a pinch.
    4. Factory reset: Set this to "Yes", save the settings by briefly holding `ENC`, then reboot. This will reset all settings to their factory defaults.


## TODO
### Need
* side loading (currently blocking everything else)
* patch outputs are very noisy, see if any of that can be fixed with a noise gate or if i just gotta deal with it
* add a downsammpling distortion option, maybe merge it with bitcrush
* each distortion algo should lower output volume as drive increases to prevent earbleed and make it safe to perform with
* bitcrush needs work
* Chorus & phaser, for them dubtastic stabs (either will add a 2nd fx page or just hide them away in the "more settings" menu)
* Consider converting MFX page gui to mini-knobs and displaying the mixer there

### Want
* output 1s2m by default
* reset pop up is too short
* consider end-of-chain limiter to prevent earbleed, particularly when drive is high
* pick a consistent name for shape/curve/contour/whatever and rename all vars to match it
* consider stereo metering in pan menu
* if no external oscs are supplied, musubi should act as a monosynth. Could also add 1 osc per channel (up to 4)
* Add more filter types
* import clouds reverb
* clockable delay
* add this disto: https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/13142/digital-distortion-effect-algorithm

## Known Bugs
* If you play with resonance too much it crashes (might be fixed? havent seen it in a while)
* Sometimes crashes when playing with the delay time
